This isn't a shop, more of a rewards system or a currency. 

# Origins

S-Coin started as a measly little shop called “ZPgamings Tutorial Shop” but ZPgaming thought that was a bit Long or it didn't roll off the tongue. Introducing ZPdolla a currency that was basically S-Coin as we know it now EXCEPT MClovers messaged ZPgaming and said something like “People don't usually like currencies that involve the founders' name” ZPgaming replied “Does S-Coin exist” MClovers replied instantly “Don't think so” so yeah that's S-Coins origin story.
